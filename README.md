1. Introduction
Managing data manually in educational institutions leads to errors, duplication, and inefficiency. A Student Management System digitizes this process using a centralized database and user-friendly interface.

2. Objectives
To maintain student records securely.

To enable quick access and editing of student data.

To generate reports like attendance, grades, etc.

To simplify admission and fee processes.

3. Existing System
Manual registers or Excel sheets are typically used. This results in:

Time-consuming operations.

Human errors.

Data redundancy.

Difficult search and retrieval.

4. Proposed System
A web/mobile application with CRUD functionalities.

Centralized database (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL).

Admin and student login access.

Automated report generation.

5. System Requirements
Software:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Angular)

Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js

Database: MySQL / SQLite

Hardware:

Minimum 4 GB RAM

Intel i3 or higher processor

6. System Design
Architecture:

Three-tier architecture: UI, Business Logic, and Database Layer.

Screens: Login, Dashboard, Student CRUD, Attendance, Grades, Reports.

Hosted on local server (can extend to cloud).

10. Testing
Unit Testing for each module.

Integration Testing between modules.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

11. Advantages
Reduced paperwork.

Accurate data management.

Time-saving and efficient.

Secure and role-based access.

12. Limitations
Requires internet and device.

Need for initial training.

Limited offline access.

13. Future Scope
Integration with biometric attendance.

Mobile app version.

Real-time parent notifications.

AI-based performance analysis.

14. Conclusion
The Student Management System improves data handling in educational institutions by offering a digital, centralized, and user-friendly solution. It enhances accuracy, accessibility, and efficiency in managing student data.
